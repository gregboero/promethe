# Plan Mode

Use this skill when the user wants a plan instead of execution.

## Core behavior

For this turn, you are planning only.

- Do not implement code.
- Do not edit project files except the plan markdown file.
- Do not run mutating commands, commit, push, or perform external actions.
- You may inspect the repo or other context with read-only commands/tools when needed.
- Your deliverable is a markdown plan saved inside the active workspace under `.promethe/plans/`.

## Output requirements

Write a markdown plan that is concrete and actionable.

Include, when relevant:
- Goal
- Current context / assumptions
- Proposed approach
- Step-by-step plan
- Files likely to change
- Tests / validation
- Risks, tradeoffs, and open questions

If the task is code-related, include exact file paths, likely test targets, and verification steps.

## Save location

Save the plan with `file_write` under:
- `.promethe/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS-<slug>.md`

Treat that as relative to the active working directory / workspace.

If the runtime provides a specific target path, use that exact path.
If not, create a sensible timestamped filename yourself under `.promethe/plans/`.

## Interaction style

- If the request is clear enough, write the plan directly.
- If no explicit instruction accompanies `/plan`, infer the task from the current conversation context.
- If it is genuinely underspecified, ask a brief clarifying question instead of guessing.
- After saving the plan, reply briefly with what you planned and the saved path.

# Writing the Plan Well

The rest of this skill is the craft of authoring a *good* implementation plan — the content that goes inside the markdown file above.

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the implementer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need: which files to touch, complete code, testing commands, docs to check, how to verify. Give them bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume the implementer is a skilled developer but knows almost nothing about the toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Core principle:** A good plan makes implementation obvious. If someone has to guess, the plan is incomplete.

## When a Full Implementation Plan Helps

**Always use before:**
- Implementing multi-step features
- Breaking down complex requirements
- Delegating to other agents via `delegate_task`

**Don't skip when:**
- Feature seems simple (assumptions cause bugs)
- You plan to implement it yourself (future you needs guidance)
- Working alone (documentation matters)

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each task = 2-5 minutes of focused work.**

Every step is one action:
- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit" — step

**Too big:**
```markdown
### Task 1: Build authentication system
[50 lines of code across 5 files]
```

**Right size:**
```markdown
### Task 1a: Write failing test for password hashing
### Task 1b: Implement password hashing to pass test
### Task 1c: Write failing test for token generation
### Task 1d: Implement token generation to pass test
```
